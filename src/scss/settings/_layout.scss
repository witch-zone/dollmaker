/*
  ~~ here be magic numbers ~~

  because we're working with fixed assets that need to scale,
  calculating aspect ratios and setting things in percentages
  based off of the sizes of content areas within the assets seemed
  like the most reasonable way to get things to actually scale

  aspect ratio of the doll and wardrobe is used to size the two main
  content areas whilst maintaining a consistent aspect ratio (thereby
  never warping the image behind it) using padding-top: {aspect-ratio}%

  frame padding is used within the doll and wardrobe containers to space
  content away from the decorative borders in the background
